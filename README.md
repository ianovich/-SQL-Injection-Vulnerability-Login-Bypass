 # SQL Injection Vulnerability Allowing Login Bypass(Portswigger Web Security Lab)
 ## Overview

This lab exercise demonstrates a SQL injection vulnerability that allows for login bypass. The goal was to identify and exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access.

## Testing the Vulnerability
**Setup and Tools:**
- **Burp Suite:** Utilized as the primary tool for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests and responses.
- **Browser:** Firefox was used to interact with the lab environment.

 ### 1 Intercepting the Request

1. **Configuring Burp Suite:**
   - Set up Burp Suite to intercept traffic from the browser.
   - Navigate to the login page of the target application and capture the login request.

### 2 Testing for SQL Injection:<br/>

Modified the captured request in Burp Suite by adding a single quote (') to the input fields.<br/>

Sent the modified request to the server.<br/>

Observed the serverâ€™s response, which showed an internal server error. This error indicated that the server's SQL query failed due to the malformed input, suggesting the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability.<br/>

 ### 3 Analyzing the Response:

The internal server error confirmed the SQL injection vulnerability.
Further testing and analysis were performed to refine the exploitation technique and verify the vulnerability.

 In this case, the successful SQL injection allowed you to bypass authentication, and the server has now delivered the content you requested, such as a dashboard or homepage, indicating that the injection was effective. The 200 OK response confirms that the request was handled correctly and the intended content was provided, showing that the login bypass through SQL injection was successful.

 ### 4 Account Information:
   - The dashboard displayed the logged-in username as **administrator**. This indicated that we had bypassed the standard login process and gained admin-level access.
